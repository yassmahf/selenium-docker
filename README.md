Test Automation Project Description
Overview

This project is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for automating software testing processes using Docker, Docker Compose, and a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline in the cloud. The primary objective is to create a robust test automation framework that integrates various tools and technologies to achieve seamless automation and deployment.

Key Components

Docker and Docker Compose: These tools are used to containerize the test automation environment, ensuring consistency and reliability across different stages of development and deployment.

Test Automation Framework: The framework is built using Java and Selenium for web application testing.
 It includes:

Page Object Model: For maintaining clean and reusable code.
Data-Driven Testing: To automate workflow tests with different sets of data.
Maven: For managing project dependencies and building the project.
Jenkins: For setting up the CI/CD pipeline to automate build, test, and deployment processes.

Applications to Automate:

Flight Reservation Application: A web application with a workflow to automate booking processes

E-commerce Vendor Admin Portal: A web-based admin portal for managing e-commerce vendors.

Project Goals

Learn Docker and Docker Compose: Understand how to use these tools in the context of test automation.
Build a Test Automation Framework: Develop a scalable and maintainable framework using Java and Selenium.
Integrate with CI/CD Pipeline: Set up Jenkins to automate the entire process of building, testing, and deploying the applications.

Key Learning Points

Core Concepts: Focus on understanding the core concepts of Docker, Selenium, and CI/CD pipelines.
Adaptability: Gain the ability to dockerize various test frameworks and applications, even beyond Selenium.
Structured Learning: Follow a structured approach to setting up and automating tests, which can later be adapted to different projects.
